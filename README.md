# lcls-mr-llrf-rtm
Firmware for the Rear Transition Module of the ATCA LLRF for LCLS.
I cloned the original respository of slaclab/lcls-mr-llrf-interlock-rtm
with the idea of uploading and releasing versions of the firmware that
correspond to: This original code, the code used for hardware version C01
and the code used for the hardware version C02 of the RTM.
